Simple book library project using ASP.NET Core Web API framework .
I built this project to apply basic concepts of repository pattern and generic repository pattern .
I used entity framework core (code first concept) , three tier architecture(DAL,BLL , Api) .
I tried to maximize seperation of concern and divide and conquer concepts to make code maintainable , scalable and readable and also to maximize reusability .
